- Use of PHPUnit

Install PHPUnit through PEAR
PHP 5.3 + initial PEAR install doesn't work -> use this syntax :
D:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0>php.exe -d phar.require_hash=0 PEAR\go-pear.phar

If PHPUnit_MockObject-1.1.1.tgz is corrupted, try again.

Run the demo on your local server:
http://localhost/cakephp_210/DemoFlickrs/index
http://localhost/cakephp_210/test.php
